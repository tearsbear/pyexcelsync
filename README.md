# PyExcelSync

PyExcelSync is a tool to get data from another excel file and write the value to existing file.
<br /> <br />
**Example** <br />
Take a look at **SourceName**
<br /> <br />
In this case, we need to get the value (**NO SURAT**) of each file and append on the column.
<br />
But the problem is... it will take a lot of times if we open one by one right? <br />
Then imagine there is a lot of source file ðŸ˜­

That's why we need a tool to make our work easier! <br />
Using **PyExcelSync** will automatically read the values of each files,

Then it will add the result to new column, next to **SourceName**
